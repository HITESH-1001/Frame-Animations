## Features

- **Smooth Animation**: Creates a seamless scrolling animation by cycling through image frames.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjust the animation speed and frame sequence.
- **Lightweight**: Pure HTML and JavaScript implementation with no external dependencies.

## Technologies

- **HTML**: Markup language for creating the structure of the animation.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for scrolling through frames and controlling the animation.
- **Frames**: A series of image files that represent each frame of the animation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HITESH-1001/Frame-Animations
    cd Frame-Animations
    ```

2. Place your frame images in the `frames/` directory. Make sure to follow the [frame naming convention](#frame-naming-convention).

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the animation.

## Usage

- Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
- The animation will automatically start and loop through the frames.
- You can customize the animation speed and behavior in the `script.js` file.

## Frame Naming Convention

To ensure smooth operation and ease of customization, use the following naming convention for your frames:

- Use the format `frame_0001.jpg`, `frame_0002.jpg`, ..., `frame_XXXX.jpg` where `XXXX` is a zero-padded number representing the frame sequence.
- Place all frame images in the `frames/` directory.
